# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## **Required Homework**

### **Distrbuted Tracing with Honeycomb**
1. Created a trial account at [honeycomb.io](https://ui.honeycomb.io/)
2. Created a new enviroment and attained the api key
3. Saved the Api key to my Codespaces secrets

![Docker compose file](assets/tracing_wk2.png)

4. To ensure all dependencies(Open telemetry "OTEL") are met, thee following was added to the [requirements.txt](../backend-flask/requirements.txt) file:
    ```txt
    opentelemetry-api 
    opentelemetry-sdk 
    opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
    opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
    opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
    ```
5. The [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file was also updated to reflect neccessary enivorment keys:
    ````yaml
    version: "3.8"
    services:
        backend-flask:
            environment:
                ...
                ...
                OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "backend-flask"
                OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
                OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
        ...
    ```

6. Next, to start getting traces in honeycomb, I added the following to the [app.py](../backend-flask/app.py):
    ```python
    ...
    ...

    # Honeycomb
    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

    # Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
    provider = TracerProvider()
    processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
    provider.add_span_processor(processor)
    trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)


    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Initialize automatic instrumentation with Flask
    FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
    RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()
    ```
7. Finally, it was time to run ```docker compose up``` and see if traces are recieved in honeycomb.

8. Below is a proof of trace in honeycomb platform.

### **Distrbuted Tracing with AWS Xray**
1. To get started with aws-xray, the following was added to the [requirements.txt](../backend-flask/requirements.txt) file to ensure the necessary sdk was dowmnloaded:
    ```txt
    aws-xray-sdk
    ```
2. In the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file, the following was added:
    ```yaml
    version: "3.8"
    services:
        backend-flask:
            environment:
                ...
                AWS_XRAY_URL: "*${CODESPACE_NAME}-4567.${GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN}*"
                AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: "xray-daemon:2000"
              
        ...
        xray-daemon:
            image: "amazon/aws-xray-daemon"
            environment:
                AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
                AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
                AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
            command:
                - "xray -o -b xray-daemon:2000"
            ports:
                - 2000:2000/udp
    ```
3. The above sets the required enviroment variables and also defines the conntainer for the xray-daemon.
4. Next was to create a group on aws-xray to ensure we could group our traces. The following command as issued in the terminal since aws cli is already installed:
    ```bash
    $ aws xray create-group \
    --group-name "Cruddur" \
    --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask\")"
    ```
5. The above should return a response with the arn and other parameters to indicate success
6. To create a samplinng rule for xray-services, a file was created in [aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/json](../aws/json/) called [xray.json](../aws/json/xray.json) with content:
    ```json
    {
    "SamplingRule": {
        "RuleName": "Cruddur",
        "ResourceARN": "*",
        "Priority": 9000,
        "FixedRate": 0.1,
        "ReservoirSize": 5,
        "ServiceName": "backend-flask",
        "ServiceType": "*",
        "Host": "*",
        "HTTPMethod": "*",
        "URLPath": "*",
        "Version": 1
        }
    }
    ```
7. In the terminal, the following command was issued: 
    ```bash
    $ aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json
    ```
8. In the [app.py](../backend-flask/app.py), the following was added:
    ```python
    ...
    ...

    # X_RAY
    from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
    from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

    xray_url = os.getenv("AWS_XRAY_URL")
    #xray_recorder.configure(service='backend-flask', dynamic_naming=xray_url)
    xray_recorder.configure(service='backend-flask') # To ensure all traces can be grouped under the Cruudr group created
    
    ......
    ......

    app = Flask(__name__)

    #XRAY
    XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
    ```
9. Started my containers and inspected aws xray in the aws console, please see evidence of traces in xray:
    
    ![trace3](./assets/tracing3_wk2.png)

    Raw Output of the image above:
    ```json

                            "sdk": "X-Ray for Python"
                        }
                    },
                    "service": {
                        "runtime": "CPython",

                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    
 ### **Logging with AWS CloudWatch**
1. As usual, added the required library/SDK to the [requirements.txt](../backend-flask/requirements.txt):
    ```txt
    watchtower
    ```
2. In the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file, the following was added:
    ```yaml
    version: "3.8"
    services:
        backend-flask:
            environment:
                ...
                AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: "${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}"
                AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
                AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
              
        ...
    ```
3. In [app.py](../backend-flask/app.py), the following was added:
    ```python
    ...
    #Cloudwatch Logs
    import watchtower
    import logging
    from time import strftime

    ...
    
    # Configuring Logger to Use CloudWatch
    LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    LOGGER.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    cw_handler = watchtower.CloudWatchLogHandler(log_group='cruddur')
    LOGGER.addHandler(console_handler)
    LOGGER.addHandler(cw_handler)
    LOGGER.info("Test Message")

    app = Flask(__name__)

    ...

    @app.after_request
    def after_request(response):
        timestamp = strftime('[%Y-%b-%d %H:%M]')
        LOGGER.error('%s %s %s %s %s %s', timestamp, request.remote_addr, request.method, request.scheme, request.full_path, response.status)
        return response
    ```
4. The compose up commannd, after a while of the container running and refreshing the pages, logs appeared on cloudwatch logs. Please see below
    ![log1](./assets/tracing4_wk2.png)
    
### **Logging with Rollbar**
1. Started by creating an account on [rollbar](https://rollbar.com), selected the right framework that is for and copied the required api-key.

2. Persisted the key in my codespace environment with name *ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN*. 

3. In the [requirements.txt](../backend-flask/requirements.txt), the following was added:
    ```txt
    blinker
    rollbar
    ```
4. In the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file, the following was added:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.8"
    services:
    backend-flask:
        environment:
        ...

        ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN: "${ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN}"        
        ...
    ```
5. In [app.py](../backend-flask/app.py), the following was also added:
    ```python
    ...
    #Rollbar
    import rollbar
    import rollbar.contrib.flask
    from flask import got_request_exception

    ...

    app = Flask(__name__)

    ...

    # Rollbar Intialize
    rollbar_access_token = os.getenv('ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN')
    @app.before_first_request
    def init_rollbar():
        """init rollbar module"""
        rollbar.init(
            # access token
            rollbar_access_token,
            # environment name
            'production',
            # server root directory, makes tracebacks prettier
            root=os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)),
            # flask already sets up logging
            allow_logging_basic_config=False)

        # send exceptions from `app` to rollbar, using flask's signal system.
        got_request_exception.connect(rollbar.contrib.flask.report_exception, app)

    @app.route('/rollbar/test')
    def rollbar_test():
        rollbar.report_message('Hello World!', 'warning')
        return "Hello World!"
    ```
6. Compose up and running the endpoint at /rollbar/test, the following log was seen on rollbar:
