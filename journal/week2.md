# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## **Required Homework**

### **Distrbuted Tracing with Honeycomb**
1. Created a trial account at [honeycomb.io](https://ui.honeycomb.io/)
2. Created a new enviroment and attained the api key
3. Saved the Api key to my Codespaces secrets

![Docker compose file](assets/tracing_wk2.png)

4. To ensure all dependencies(Open telemetry "OTEL") are met, thee following was added to the [requirements.txt](../backend-flask/requirements.txt) file:
    ```txt
    opentelemetry-api 
    opentelemetry-sdk 
    opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
    opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
    opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
    ```
5. The [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file was also updated to reflect neccessary enivorment keys:
    ````yaml
    version: "3.8"
    services:
        backend-flask:
            environment:
                ...
                ...
                OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "backend-flask"
                OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
                OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
        ...
    ```

6. Next, to start getting traces in honeycomb, I added the following to the [app.py](../backend-flask/app.py):
    ```python
    ...
    ...

    # Honeycomb
    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

    # Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
    provider = TracerProvider()
    processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
    provider.add_span_processor(processor)
    trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)


    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Initialize automatic instrumentation with Flask
    FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
    RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()
    ```
7. Finally, it was time to run ```docker compose up``` and see if traces are recieved in honeycomb.

8. Below is a proof of trace in honeycomb platform.

### **Distrbuted Tracing with AWS Xray**
1. To get started with aws-xray, the following was added to the [requirements.txt](../backend-flask/requirements.txt) file to ensure the necessary sdk was dowmnloaded:
    ```txt
    aws-xray-sdk
    ```
2. In the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file, the following was added:
    ```yaml
    version: "3.8"
    services:
        backend-flask:
            environment:
                ...
                AWS_XRAY_URL: "*${CODESPACE_NAME}-4567.${GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN}*"
                AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: "xray-daemon:2000"
              
        ...
        xray-daemon:
            image: "amazon/aws-xray-daemon"
            environment:
                AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
                AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
                AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
            command:
                - "xray -o -b xray-daemon:2000"
            ports:
                - 2000:2000/udp
    ```
3. The above sets the required enviroment variables and also defines the conntainer for the xray-daemon.
4. Next was to create a group on aws-xray to ensure we could group our traces. The following command as issued in the terminal since aws cli is already installed:
    ```bash
    $ aws xray create-group \
    --group-name "Cruddur" \
    --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask\")"
    ```
5. The above should return a response with the arn and other parameters to indicate success
6. To create a samplinng rule for xray-services, a file was created in [aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/json](../aws/json/) called [xray.json](../aws/json/xray.json) with content:
    ```json
    {
    "SamplingRule": {
        "RuleName": "Cruddur",
        "ResourceARN": "*",
        "Priority": 9000,
        "FixedRate": 0.1,
        "ReservoirSize": 5,
        "ServiceName": "backend-flask",
        "ServiceType": "*",
        "Host": "*",
        "HTTPMethod": "*",
        "URLPath": "*",
        "Version": 1
        }
    }
    ```
7. In the terminal, the following command was issued: 
    ```bash
    $ aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json
    ```
8. In the [app.py](../backend-flask/app.py), the following was added:
    ```python
    ...
    ...

    # X_RAY
    from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
    from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

    xray_url = os.getenv("AWS_XRAY_URL")
    #xray_recorder.configure(service='backend-flask', dynamic_naming=xray_url)
    xray_recorder.configure(service='backend-flask') # To ensure all traces can be grouped under the Cruudr group created
    
    ......
    ......

    app = Flask(__name__)

    #XRAY
    XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
    ```
9. Started my containers and inspected aws xray in the aws console, please see evidence of traces in xray:

    Raw Output of the image above:
